# Code Signing & Notarization Configuration
# Copy this file to .env.signing and fill in your Apple Developer credentials
# Then source it before building: source .env.signing && ./create-app-bundle.sh

# Your Apple Developer ID Application certificate
# Find it with: security find-identity -v -p codesigning
# Example: "Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
export CODESIGN_IDENTITY=""

# Keychain profile for notarization (created with xcrun notarytool store-credentials)
# To create: xcrun notarytool store-credentials "ProfileName" --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id "TEAMID"
export NOTARY_KEYCHAIN_PROFILE=""

# Bundle identifier (optional, defaults to com.weightlifting.editor)
# export BUNDLE_ID="com.yourcompany.WeightliftingEditor"

# Notes:
# - For local development, you don't need to set these variables
# - Unsigned builds work fine for personal use
# - For distribution to other Macs, signing and notarization are required
# - App-specific password can be generated at: appleid.apple.com
